# Channel Analysis Failure Debug Plan

## Problem
Analysis failing for youtube.com/@mkbhd with error "Analysis Failed - Something went wrong while analyzing the channel"

## Debugging Strategy

### 1. Identify Which API Endpoint is Being Used
- Check if this is happening on the public landing page (uses `/api/demo`)
- Or on the authenticated analyze page (uses `/api/analyze`)
- Check browser network tab for the actual API call and response

### 2. Check YouTube API Integration
- Verify YouTube API key is set in environment variables
- Check if the channel ID extraction is working for @mkbhd format
- Test YouTube API directly to see if it's returning data

### 3. Common Failure Points
1. **Channel ID Extraction**
   - @mkbhd format might not be properly parsed
   - Need to resolve @handle to actual channel ID

2. **YouTube API Issues**
   - API key might be missing or invalid
   - API quota might be exceeded
   - Channel might require special permissions

3. **Data Processing Errors**
   - Null/undefined values in API response
   - Type mismatches in data processing
   - Missing required fields

4. **Database/Cache Issues**
   - Database connection failures
   - Cache retrieval errors
   - Data validation failures

### 4. Step-by-Step Debugging Process

1. **Add Logging to Track Flow**
   - Log at the start of API endpoint
   - Log after channel ID extraction
   - Log YouTube API responses
   - Log any errors with full stack traces

2. **Test Channel ID Resolution**
   - The @mkbhd format needs to be resolved to a channel ID
   - YouTube API requires either channel ID or handle resolution

3. **Check Environment Variables**
   - YOUTUBE_API_KEY must be set
   - DATABASE_URL must be valid
   - Any other required env vars

4. **Test with Different Formats**
   - Try full URL: https://youtube.com/@mkbhd
   - Try channel ID directly if known
   - Try other channels to see if it's MKBHD-specific

### 5. Implementation Steps

1. First, check which endpoint is being called
2. Add comprehensive error logging
3. Fix channel handle resolution
4. Add proper error messages to identify exact failure point
5. Test and verify the fix

## Expected Issues

Based on the URL format "youtube.com/@mkbhd", the most likely issues are:
1. The @ handle format isn't being properly resolved to a channel ID
2. The YouTube API call is failing due to missing/invalid API key
3. The channel data structure has unexpected format causing processing errors
