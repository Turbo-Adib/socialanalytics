# Discord OAuth Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete Discord OAuth integration for course member access control, allowing users to sign in with Discord and automatically receive course member privileges if they're part of the course Discord server.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Authentication System Updates**
- **File**: `src/lib/auth.ts`
  - Added Discord OAuth provider
  - Implemented signIn callback to verify Discord membership
  - Auto-assigns COURSE_MEMBER role to verified Discord members
  - Updates user database with Discord ID and last check timestamp

### 2. **Discord Utilities**
- **File**: `src/lib/discord.ts`
  - `checkDiscordMembership()`: Verifies if user is in specified Discord server
  - `getUserDiscordInfo()`: Fetches Discord user information
  - `determineUserRole()`: Logic for role assignment based on membership

### 3. **Database Schema Updates**
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - Added `discordId` field to User model
  - Added `lastDiscordCheck` field to track verification timestamps
- **Migration**: `20250627064546_add_discord_fields`

### 4. **UI Components**
- **File**: `src/components/DiscordLoginButton.tsx`
  - Reusable Discord login button with official Discord branding
  - Customizable text and styling options

### 5. **Page Updates**
- **File**: `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`
  - Added Discord login option prominently displayed
  - Special section for course members
  - Maintains existing email/password and admin code options

- **File**: `src/app/course/page.tsx`
  - Landing page for course information
  - Shows benefits of course membership
  - Redirects existing members to dashboard
  - Call-to-action for non-members

### 6. **API Endpoints**

#### Periodic Verification
- **File**: `src/app/api/cron/verify-discord/route.ts`
  - Endpoint for automated membership verification
  - Checks all Discord users' membership status
  - Revokes access if no longer in Discord server
  - Secured with CRON_SECRET for external cron services

#### Manual Verification
- **File**: `src/app/api/auth/verify-discord/route.ts`
  - Allows users to manually trigger membership check
  - Updates role based on current Discord status
  - Logs all changes for audit trail

### 7. **Environment Variables**
- **File**: `.env.example`
  ```bash
  DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your-discord-app-client-id"
  DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="your-discord-app-client-secret"
  DISCORD_GUILD_ID="your-discord-server-id"
  DISCORD_COURSE_ROLE_ID="your-course-member-role-id" # Optional
  CRON_SECRET="your-secure-cron-secret"
  ```

### 8. **Documentation**
- **File**: `docs/DISCORD_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
  - Comprehensive setup guide
  - Discord app configuration steps
  - Environment variable setup
  - Cron job configuration options
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security considerations

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - User clicks "Sign in with Discord" button
   - Redirected to Discord OAuth consent page
   - After authorization, system checks Discord server membership
   - If member (and optionally has specific role), grants COURSE_MEMBER access
   - Creates/updates user record with Discord information

2. **Automatic Access Management**:
   - Hourly cron job verifies all Discord users
   - Checks if they're still in the Discord server
   - Automatically revokes access if they've left
   - All changes are logged in audit trail

3. **Integration with LaunchPass**:
   - LaunchPass handles initial Discord invite when course is purchased
   - Our system verifies continued membership
   - Seamless experience: buy course → join Discord → get tool access
   - Cancel subscription → lose Discord access → automatically lose tool access

## Security Features

- OAuth tokens are securely stored by NextAuth
- Membership verification happens server-side
- Rate limiting considerations for Discord API
- Audit logging for all access changes
- Secure cron endpoint with bearer token authentication

## Benefits

1. **For Course Creators**:
   - No manual code management
   - Automatic access control
   - Can't be shared or leaked
   - Easy to revoke access

2. **For Students**:
   - Simple one-click login
   - No codes to remember
   - Access tied to Discord membership
   - Works seamlessly with course platform

## Testing Instructions

1. Set up Discord application and environment variables
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/auth/signin`
4. Click "Sign in with Discord"
5. Verify access is granted/denied based on Discord membership

## Future Enhancements

- Add Discord role syncing (multiple tiers)
- Discord webhook integration for instant updates
- Analytics on Discord member activity
- Integration with Discord bot for notifications
