## 📊 Business Logic & Rules

### Usage Limits & Rate Limiting
```
PHILOSOPHY: "Unlimited" feel with smart backend controls

FREE TRIAL USERS:
- 3 total channel analyses (hard limit)
- No daily reset, lifetime limit
- Basic insights only, no advanced features
- Upgrade prompts after each analysis

SAAS SUBSCRIBERS:
- Rate limiting: 5 analyses per hour (invisible to user)
- Soft daily limits: 25 (Basic) / 50 (Pro) analyses
- Progressive slowdowns for heavy usage
- Background processing during peak times

COURSE MEMBERS:
- Rate limiting: 10 analyses per hour
- No daily or monthly limits
- Priority processing queue
- Full feature access forever

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Redis-based sliding window rate limiting
- Graceful degradation instead of hard blocks
- Queue position indicators during delays
- "High demand" messaging instead of "limit reached"
```

### Revenue Calculation Engine
```
BASE FORMULA: 
Monthly Revenue = (Monthly Views × Niche RPM × Creator Share)

VARIABLES:
- Creator Share: 55% (YouTube takes 45%)
- Niche RPM: Varies by content category
- Geographic Multiplier: US/UK higher, global average lower
- Seasonal Adjustment: Q4 +20%, Q1 -15%

NICHE-SPECIFIC RPM RATES:
- Technology: $3.00-$6.00 per 1,000 views
- Gaming: $1.50-$3.00 per 1,000 views
- Finance/Investing: $4.00-$8.00 per 1,000 views
- Education: $2.50-$4.50 per 1,000 views
- Beauty/Fashion: $1.50-$3.50 per 1,000 views
- Fitness/Health: $2.00-$4.00 per 1,000 views
- Food/Cooking: $1.80-$3.20 per 1,000 views
- Travel/Lifestyle: $2.20-$4.00 per 1,000 views

SHORTS CALCULATION:
- Fixed rate: $0.15 per 1,000 views globally
- No niche variation for Shorts content
- Lower revenue share due to different monetization model

VALIDATION RULES:
- Show ranges instead of exact figures ($X - $Y format)
- Include disclaimers about estimate accuracy
- Compare against known creator earnings when possible
- Flag unrealistic estimates for manual review
```

### Content Analysis Algorithms
```
OUTLIER DETECTION:
1. Calculate channel average views per video
2. Identify videos with 2+ standard deviations above/below mean
3. Categorize as high performers (2x+ average) or underperformers (<50% average)
4. Extract patterns from top 10% performing content

TITLE PATTERN ANALYSIS:
- Extract common phrases and structures
- Identify high-performing keywords and hooks
- Analyze title length correlation with performance
- Detect question vs statement patterns

TOPIC CATEGORIZATION:
- NLP analysis of titles and descriptions
- Keyword extraction and clustering
- Manual topic mapping for accuracy
- Performance correlation by topic category

TIMING ANALYSIS:
- Upload day/time correlation with performance
- Seasonal performance patterns
- Video length optimization recommendations
- Series vs standalone content analysis
```
